            <h2>Introduction to C++:</h2>
            <p>C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s
                as
                an extension of the C language.
                It is widely used for system/software development, game development, and applications requiring high
                performance.</p>

            <h3>Key Features of C++:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
                    C++ supports OOP principles like classes and objects, which help organize code and promote
                    reusability.
                </li>
                <li>Rich Standard Library:
                    It offers a wide range of built-in functions and libraries, which helps in reducing development
                    time.
                </li>
                <li>High Performance:
                    C++ allows low-level memory manipulation, enabling developers to optimize performance-critical
                    applications.</li>

        <!-- Array -->
        <section id="third">
            <h2>Introduction to Arrays</h2>

            <h3>What is an Array?</h3>
            <p>An array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple elements of the same type in a contiguous
                block of memory. Each element in the array is assigned an index, starting from 0, which can be used to
                access or modify the elements directly. Arrays provide an efficient way to store and manage data because
                you
                can access any element quickly using its index. However, arrays have a fixed size, meaning once you
                create
                an array, you cannot change its size, and all elements must be of the same type.</p>

            <img src="Arrays.webp" alt="Array picture">

            <h3>Characteristics of Arrays</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Fixed Size: Once an array is created, its size is fixed and cannot be dynamically altered during
                    runtime. This means the number of elements it can hold is predetermined.</li>
                <li>Index-Based Access: Elements in an array are accessed by their index, starting at 0 for the first
                    element. This allows for direct access to any element, making retrieval fast and efficient.</li>
                <li>Homogeneous Data: All elements in an array must be of the same type, whether integers,
                    floating-point
                    numbers, or other data types, ensuring consistency in the data being stored.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Types of Arrays
            </h3>

            <ol>
                <li>One-Dimensional Arrays: These are simple arrays where elements are stored in a single row, and each
                    element can be accessed using one index. Itâ€™s essentially a list of items in a straight line.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: int arr[5]; (This can hold 5 integer values).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Multi-Dimensional Arrays: These arrays are like arrays within arrays. They are used to represent
                    data in
                    grids, tables, or matrices, where elements are accessed using multiple indices (like rows and
                    columns in
                    a matrix).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: int grid[2][3]; (This is a 2x3 grid of integers).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Dynamic Arrays: Unlike static arrays, dynamic arrays can grow or shrink in size during program
                    execution. They are often implemented using resizable data structures, like vectors or ArrayLists,
                    that
                    can adjust their capacity.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: In C++, std::vector<int> v; allows a dynamic list of integers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ol>

            <!-- Tree -->
            <h2>Introduction to Trees</h2>

            <h3>What is a Tree?</h3>
            <p>A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and a list of
                references to other nodes (children). A tree has a root node, and each child of a node is a subtree.
                Trees are widely used for representing hierarchical data, such as file systems, databases, and more.</p>

            <img src="Trees.webp" alt="Tree Structure">

            <h3>Characteristics of Trees</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Root Node: The topmost node of a tree, which does not have any parent.</li>
                <li>Child Nodes: Nodes that are directly connected to a parent node. Each node can have multiple
                    children.</li>
                <li>Leaf Nodes: Nodes that do not have any children, located at the bottom of the tree structure.</li>
                <li>Height: The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node, representing the depth of the
                    tree.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Trees</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Binary Tree: A tree where each node has at most two children (left and right).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: A tree with nodes representing family relationships.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Binary Search Tree (BST): A type of binary tree where the left child has a value less than its
                    parent node, and the right child has a value greater than its parent node.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: A BST that helps in efficient searching and sorting of elements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights of left and right
                    subtrees is at most 1, ensuring efficient operations.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: A balanced tree to maintain fast lookup times.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h2>Introduction to Graphs</h2>

            <h3>What is a Graph?</h3>
            <p>A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that connect
                pairs of vertices. Graphs can represent various types of relationships and connections between data
                points. They are widely used in computer science to model networks, such as social networks,
                transportation systems, and communication networks. Graphs can be either directed or undirected,
                depending on whether the edges have a direction associated with them.</p>

            <img src="GraphS.webp" alt="Graph structure picture">

            <h3>Characteristics of Graphs</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Vertices and Edges: A graph is made up of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections), where each edge
                    connects two vertices.</li>
                <li>Directed and Undirected: In directed graphs, edges have a direction, indicating a one-way
                    relationship, while in undirected graphs, edges represent a two-way relationship.</li>
                <li>Weighted and Unweighted: Graphs can be weighted, meaning edges have associated costs or distances,
                    or unweighted, where all edges are considered equal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Graphs</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Undirected Graph: A graph where edges have no direction. The relationship between vertices is
                    mutual.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: An undirected graph can represent friendships in a social network.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Directed Graph (Digraph): A graph where edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship
                    between vertices.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: A directed graph can represent a road map where roads only allow travel in one
                            direction.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Weighted Graph: A graph where each edge has a weight or cost associated with it, often used to
                    represent distances or costs in a network.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: A weighted graph can be used to find the shortest path in a transportation network.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs: Cyclic graphs contain cycles (paths that return to the same vertex),
                    while acyclic graphs do not contain cycles.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: Acyclic graphs are used in representing hierarchical structures, like
                            organizational charts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
